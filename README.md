# palette-generator-hsl
This is the first JS project I'm doing without following a tutorial. Please contact me if anything is wrong or if you wanna say anything about it.

Took me about a week to finish this because I didn't know a lot about JS and initially the input was an Hex color, which required a lot of functions to convert the value to rgb then to hsl, then back to rgb then back to Hex, to check if the input was right etc etc... Manipulating Hex values was way too complicated compared to HSL values, but I did learn thanks to my mistakes :)

At first I didn't know HSL actually existed but it made the project MUCH MUCH easier and I would recommend it for any palette generator

Special thanks to Davy Henry for helping me on this! He saved me a lot of lines by putting a lot of functions in a single one (storing the color offsets in an array inside another array and looping through it for each color created).
