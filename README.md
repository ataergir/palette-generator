# palette-generator-hsl

Took me about a week to finish this because I didn't know a lot about JS and initially the input was an Hex color, which required a lot of functions to convert the value to rgb then to hsl, then back to rgb then back to Hex, to check if the input was right etc etc... Manipulating Hex values was way too complicated compared to HSL values, but I did learn thanks to my mistakes :)

At first I didn't even know HSL actually existed but it made the project MUCH MUCH easier and I would recommend it for any palette generator
